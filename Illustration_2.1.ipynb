    "Here, the default negation takes on its full meaning. \n",
    "Unless explicitly stated that a bird cannot fly using the predicate, it is assumed that the bird can fly. \n",

    "\n",
    "Next, the problem instance is specified in lines 8 and 9, which represent our knowledge base. \n",
    "These lines state that `ricky` is an eagle and `casper` is a penguin. \n",

    "```\n",
    "These lines indicate that a solution (or answer) that satisfies the problem was found.\n",

    "1. `bird(casper)` meaning that `casper` is a bird ;\n",
    "2. `bird(ricky)` meaning that `ricky` is a bird ;\n",
    "3. `neg_fly(casper)` meaning that `casper` cannot fly ;\n",
    "4. `fly(ricky)` meaning that `ricky` can fly ;\n",
    "5. `eagle(ricky)` meaning that `ricky` is an eagle ;\n",
    "6. `penguin(casper)` meaning that `casper` is a penguin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the program allows us to determine that `ricky` can fly.\n",

    "This makes them less informative.\n",
    "To address this issue, we can filter the output predicates to display only the relevant information for our problem.\n",
    "This is achieved in the following program via the `#show` instructions (see next cell).\n",
